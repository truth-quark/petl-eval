# ETL Tools

Notes from quick & dirty evaluation of libraries from a web search.

* `petl` - small, efficient, table oriented
* ~~`Bonobo` - no updates in 3 years~~
* ~~`Mara` - depends on PostgresSQL~~
* ~~`Pygrametl` - around 10 years, hasn't taken off, looks clunky/DB like~~
* `Riko` - data extraction, looks less useful
